So the title is pretty self explantory but I would like to talk about it with examples from my life (more like memories). I remember being super obsessed with trumpet and spending all my free time that senior to get good at trumpet since I was the marching band section leader. Like I would legit spend hours practicing and blowing my lips out to play higher notes (cuz that's criteria for a good trumpet player). I wasn't that busy with other stuff in that senior year of high school, so my only goal was to get good and do anything I could to achieve that goal. But I was okay at best and when I couldn't play well or high (which was pretty often), I would be really upset and spend more time just to "get it". i cared so much about trumpet and how I well I could perform for a large portion of that senior year. And then once my high school career was over, I literally couldn't care less about trumpet. Before, being good at trumpet was the only thing I ever wanted. Till this day, I don't care about trumpet. The bombardment of schoolwork at UMICH and not failing classes is much more important to me now.

When I was small, my mom would travel about an 2 hours each day to get to and back from work. Some days, she would come home with some crispy chicken and apple pie from Kroger, or black forrest cake from Nino's, or tasty soup from Fresh Thyme. Me and my dad and my mom would all eat that "evening snack" together as a family and watch TV or talk. I think this trend continued while I was in high school up untill Covid hit. Parents were work from home and there was no going out even after Covid cuz remote work was the new norm. My mom still brought stuff like a pie when she went to the store though. And then when I went to college, its like you don't have like that family time anymore.Everything is indepedent and family is as close as the telephone (which may sound close but is not very close tbh) and no closer.
