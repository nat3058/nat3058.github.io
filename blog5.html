So I've been working with C and Assembly for my Computer Organization class. I first read Assembly when I wanted to learn how to reverse engineer stuff. But it was kinda hard and I was left with the impression that Assembly is just pretty difficult. But after writing a multiplier in Assembly (albeit LC2k), its not that bad but it was pretty daunting to begin. And I only had a few hours left before it was due. But thanks to the help of friends and God's Grace, I got it done in time.
