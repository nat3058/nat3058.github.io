So we are all aware about Michigan's stellar football 2022 season....if your not aware, please be aware :)


Anyway, in one of the post-game interviews, quarterback JJ Mccarthy said 2 key things that I found to be good. I can't remember the context for when he said this (maybe it was his mindset going into the 2nd half of the game). 
But he said: </p>
<span>
     ___________________________________<br>
	1) Be in the moment		<br>
     	2) Have next-play mentality     <br> 
     ___________________________________<br>
</span>
<p>	
This is just good general advice for a sports game, but also for any game including life. JJ isn't God and the two key points up there are not necessarily an absolute. But they can be helpful to remember when the odds are against you or things aren't going your way, but you know you have a goal to achieve.
