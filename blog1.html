	<h1> know your tools </h1>
	<p> It's important to know your tools in order to be productive and efficient and not spend too much time on mundane tasks and procedures. It really is not fun spending your life on learning and working and then ultimately retiring and regretting all the time that you lost that you could have used to do more fun and meaningful things with friends and family. I hope this will not be me, nor you.

It is true that certain tools can make you productive and enhance your productivity. While that is well and good, now everyone needs emacs productivity. You can still use easy-to-learn and comfortable tools to get the job done. This exactlywhy i am using Clion and it has worked well for me. 

Currently, i am learning how to use git and github for version control. I think it will help me personally in my projects and working with groups like Spark.
