	<h1> Emacs or Vim ? </h1>
<p>
I used to be huge emacs fanboy, but now I am using vim to create these static webpages you are currently viewing. I am vim newbie and the emacs keybindings have really messed me up. vim is okay for now tho. I really like its syntax highlighting ngl. <a href="https://wilkesley.org/~ian/xah/emacs/emacs_pinky.html">This website</a> can be helpful for avoiding the "emacs pinky", but my main issue with emacs is that you have you have to hold the control/caps lock key in tandem with another key press. I guess I could use sticky keys but I have never used them before, and i just don't think its worth it. vim seems to be working fine for me so far, so... </p>

Update -- jan 1. 2023:
So I am much less of a Emacs fanboy. For any sort of major programming, i just use IDEs like CLion or VSCode. For any sort of file editing, I generally just use Vim or an simple text editor on Mac. So, even though i was like super confused as to what i should use as my main text editor, it looks like its not a big deal. Whatever works is the best.
