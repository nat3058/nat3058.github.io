<h1>Get to Work!</h2>

<span style="font-size:22px">

Putting a title to something is always interesting. I like the title of this blog post cuz its about finding work experience as a young college student. Finding and Getting a job or internship takes work. And then once you get it,you must actually go to work. So...Get to work!, both before and after you get a job.

<br><br>
Now that we got the title business out of the way....let us commence.
<br><br>

Today, the Winter Career Fair was hosted by UofM. I did not go, and I am sure that my parents will not be happy with that. I have some reasonable excuses for not going (health and school reasons). I agree that I should have gone and it doesn't hurt to go and stand in line. But at the same time, I'm very sure I didn't miss much. Like one of my friends said, "it felt like a waste of time". 

<br>
<br>

The career fair isn't the golden gateway to a job/internship. Even from a elite school, it just isn't. They will just tell you to apply online. Also, the numbers are kinda stacked against you. Lots of applicants per job. Solution:apply to a bunch of jobs.
<br> 
But there's gotta to be other ways too....right?
<br><br>
I was told that as college students, we are basically a charity. Yes, you read that right. But charity in a good way. Like, alumni want to help you cuz they remember when they were college students.
AHA!<br>

We must talk to alumni (do some research on what they do and who they are beforehand), ask what they do for their work or other questions relevant to them, and if all fits well--> ask for any opportunites available or see if they can help you get that open position in their company. 
<br>
This is just general idea, but you get the point. 

<br><br>
IF you are currently yawning, I don't blame you. This is a tedious and also somewhat boring process that is also unpredictable.
<br>
So lets instead, do projects ourselves that have impact and are acutally interesting to work on. Maybe we come up with something new and start a new business. Or we develop some credability or notability in the field due to our work. Or worst case, we add it as a highlight of our resume that employers see and are intruiged by. Just do something that's intersesting and cool with technology and hopefully it creates some impact/value and you can maybe make money off it directly or indirectly(helps you get that job).  
<br><br>
In the end, whether you are currently working or not, working on personal projects helps you learn stuff and project value as a result of your work. It just takes time.
