<h1>My personal website</h1>
	<p>Hello, my name is Nathan. I used to be huge emacs fanboy, but now I am using vim to create these static webpages you are currently viewing. I am a vim new and the emacs keybindings have really messed me up. vim is okay for now tho. I really like its syntax highlighting ngl. <a href="https://wilkesley.org/~ian/xah/emacs/emacs_pinky.html">This website</a> can be helpful for avoiding the "emacs pinky", but my main issue with emacs is that you have you have to hold the control/caps lock key in tandem with another key press. I guess I could use sticky keys but I have never used them before, and i just don't think its worth it. vim seems to be working fine for me so far, so... </p>
